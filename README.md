# Hello, this is my personal portfolio website!

## Purpose

I developed this website so that I can learn some front-end skills -- mainly HTML and CSS. Whilst also showcasing some of my projects I have completed.

In addition, I've learned more about setting up a custom domain, email, and DNS servers.

## Domain Hosting

Website has been hosted via Cloudflare Pages.

## Acknowledgements

For the front banner and navbar, I used some starter code from codepen.io. As codepen.io provided some nice javascript animations.
