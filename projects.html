        Geared towards the Justice Hack category, my team of four created a interactive college tuition heat-map with options to select both 2-year community colleges and 4-year universities to reveal the college-cost desparity. I figured out how to get useful & specific info from the college scorecard API, and teaching it to my members so they can load up the DB. Using Javascript I programmed the heatmap to better visualize the education cost based on tuition -- via setting up different tuition thresholds that correspond to a certain color (eg. green or purple). Also assisted with UI/UX (eg. adding some dot plots), along providing some ideas as my other teammates did other front-end and back-end work.

    <p>
      Here is a video game programmed in <b>Verilog</b> running on a Basys3 FPGA device. Where the objective is to jump
      (via the physical buttons) and catch the yellow flying squares to get a point. The physical 7-segment display on
      the FPGA reflects the current score. The VGA video output (H-sync, V-sync) utilizes a counter for each pixel.

    <h2 style="color:#67C2FF">Gyro Bluetooth Mouse</h2>
    <p>
      Using an ESP32 and its ESP-IDF framework, I used the accelerometer's readings and set certain thresholds of tilt
      to determine the speed of the mouse -- allowing very precise movements. Since its bluetooth, it can be paired with
      a bluetooth-enabled computer.

    <p> In my captsone course (group of 3), we connected three sensor-equipped Raspberry Piâ€™s (RPi) via Ad-Hoc in both a
      Polling and Token-Ring topology. The sensors measure wind-speed, relative temperature/humidity, and soil
      temperature/humidity. Sensor data is sent to a MySQL database hosted on a local computer, that also hosts a
      website displaying current Wildfire risk and plots for each RPi. </p>
